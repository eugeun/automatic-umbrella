# OctoAcme Project Management Overview

## Purpose
Provide a concise, shareable introduction to how OctoAcme runs projects so new teammates can quickly understand our approach, roles, and key artifacts.

## Scope
Applies to all cross-functional projects that deliver product features, services, or integrations.

## Principles
- Customer-first: prioritize customer value and usability.
- Iterative delivery: deliver small, testable increments.
- Clear ownership: each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead.
- Data-informed decisions: measure impact and iterate based on evidence.
- Psychological safety: encourage feedback and learning.

## Core Roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, schedules, risk, communications.
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, and measures success.
- Developers: implement features, collaborate on design and testability.
- QA/Testing: validate quality and acceptance criteria.
- Stakeholders: provide inputs and approvals.
- Release Manager: owns the end-to-end release process, from scheduling to post-deploy review.
- QA Automation Engineer: builds and maintains automated test suites and CI quality gates.
- UX Designer: translates product requirements into user flows, designs, and prototypes.
- Support Specialist: resolves escalated customer issues and feeds learnings back to Product and Engineering.
- DevOps Engineer: builds and operates the CI/CD pipelines and deployment infrastructure.

For detailed responsibilities and interaction guidance for each role, see [docs/octoacme-roles-and-personas.md](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md).

## Key Artifacts
- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

## Lifecycle (high-level)
1. Initiation: problem statement, stakeholders, high-level timeline.
2. Planning: scope, resources, milestones, dependencies.
3. Execution: build, test, review, iterate.
4. Release: deploy, verify, announce.
5. Close & Retrospective: capture learnings and next steps.

## Communication Cadence
- Weekly sync between PM + PdM
- Twice-weekly standups for delivery team (or as agreed)
- Monthly stakeholder updates
- Ad-hoc escalations as needed

## How to use these docs
- Keep the Project Charter updated in the project repo.
- Add process-specific docs into `.copilot/` if you want Copilot Spaces to use them as context.
- Operational checklists and guidance are available under `docs/`: see [release-manager-checklist.md](release-manager-checklist.md) for the release process and [qa-automation-guidelines.md](qa-automation-guidelines.md) for CI/test integration practices.
